# Quantifying model prediction sensitivity to model-form uncertainty
This repository contains the source code required to reproduce the results in [1]. 

Jupyter notebooks describe their purpose and utilize the source code in Python script files.
A test suite is included in the `test/` directory.

Data from DNS simulations detailed in [2] sufficient to reproduce results for the contaminant transport exemplar problem is provided in the `DNS_data`.
